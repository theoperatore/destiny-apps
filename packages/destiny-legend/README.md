# Destiny Legend

View your character's progression as a story from beginning to where you are now. View events as they happened via Activities, Milestones, acquisitions of Exotic and other noteworthy gear in a neat story form.

# Local Development

It's a traditional [create-react-app]() front end that uses a custom [destiny client](). Clone the repo then:

```bash
# npm or yarn
yarn install
```

Then start it up:

```bash
# npm or yarn
yarn start
```
